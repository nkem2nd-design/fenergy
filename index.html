  <h1>Fusion Energy ⚛️</h1>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The push for fusion energy has reached an exciting point with recent milestones
    at the Joint European Torus (JET) in Oxfordshire, where scientists produced
    69 megajoules of energy from a tiny amount of fuel. This demonstrates that fusion
    could one day provide a nearly limitless, zero-carbon source of power.
  </p>

  <h2>Ethical, Social, and Economic Considerations</h2>
  <p>
    With this potential comes strong ethical responsibility. Scientists, governments,
    and institutions must ensure fusion is developed safely, fairly, and for peaceful
    purposes. If fusion becomes a main energy source, society will require new skills,
    education, and long-term investment in infrastructure and workforce training.
  </p>

  <p>
    Economically, countries that prepare socially and technically can gain significant
    advantages, while those that fail to invest may fall behind. Fusion could also
    reduce inequalities in access to clean energy, as hydrogen isotopes are widely
    available across the world.
  </p>

  <h2>Environmental Impact</h2>
  <p>
    Fusion energy offers major environmental benefits. It produces minimal waste,
    emits no greenhouse gases, and could significantly reduce pollution and climate
    change impacts. Unlike intermittent renewable sources, fusion can provide a
    constant and reliable supply of electricity.
  </p>

  <h2>Technical Challenges</h2>
  <p>
    Achieving sustained fusion requires controlling plasma at temperatures above
    100 million degrees Celsius, maintaining magnetic confinement, and developing
    materials capable of withstanding intense neutron bombardment. These challenges
    demand advanced engineering, materials science, and digital monitoring systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Further Research and Development (Q4)</h2>
  <p>
    The articles collectively highlight several areas requiring further development,
    including sustained net energy gain, long-term materials durability, tritium fuel
    breeding, reactor scalability, economic feasibility, and regulatory readiness.
    While experimental successes are promising, fusion has not yet achieved continuous,
    grid-ready electricity production.
  </p>

  <h2>Benefits and Challenges (Q5)</h2>
  <p>
    Fusion energy offers transformative environmental, social, and economic benefits,
    including clean energy production, workforce development, and long-term economic
    growth. However, major technical, financial, and societal challenges remain,
    including high costs, long development timelines, and the need for public trust
    and regulation.
  </p>

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    Overall, fusion energy represents a powerful scientific opportunity rather than an
    immediate solution. Continued international collaboration, transparent governance,
    and sustained research are essential before fusion can become a viable and equitable
    global energy source.
