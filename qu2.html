    <h2>Question 2</h2>

    <p>
      The various org/individuals in the articles might have an influence on the scientific issue;
    </p>

    <p>
      The Joint European Torus (JET), operated by the UK Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) and supported by the EUROfusion consortium. In Article 1, JET sets a world record for fusion energy output, providing critical experimental data under near power-plant conditions. Although it does not achieve net electricity generation, its long operational history strongly influences reactor design, plasma physics understanding, and future projects such as ITER. Its influence is therefore primarily scientific and technical, shaping how future fusion reactors are designed and evaluated.
    </p>

    <p>
      The International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) appears as the central stepping stone between experimental fusion and commercial viability. Its scale, international backing (including the EU, UK, US, China, Japan, and others), and long timeline mean it strongly influences global research direction, funding allocation, engineering standards, and public expectations. Delays and cost overruns discussed in Articles 1 and 2 also influence scepticism and policy decisions, demonstrating ITER’s political and economic impact in addition to its scientific role.
    </p>

    <p>
      The National Ignition Facility (NIF) in the United States is another major influence, particularly highlighted in Article 2. NIF achieved the first instance of net energy gain in a controlled fusion reaction, marking a significant physics milestone. However, the article clarifies that NIF’s primary mission is nuclear weapons research rather than energy generation, limiting its direct influence on commercial fusion. Its impact is therefore scientific rather than practical, contributing to fundamental understanding rather than power-grid deployment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Individuals such as Professor Ian Chapman, CEO of the UKAEA, influence fusion by shaping national strategy, workforce development, and regulation. Article 1 highlights Chapman’s role in framing fusion realistically while supporting long-term investment, he helps manage public expectations and supports responsible, step-by-step development of the technology. while Article 3 emphasises the importance of bespoke regulatory frameworks, such as the UK’s fusion-specific licensing approach, which could accelerate or delay deployment.
    </p>

    <p>
      Tony Donné, the Programme Manager of EUROfusion, His role involves coordinating fusion research across multiple European countries. Donné influences the scientific issue by promoting international collaboration, ensuring that knowledge, resources, and experimental data are shared efficiently. This cooperation accelerates progress while reducing duplication of effort and costs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Government ministers and policymakers, such as UK government science and energy officials, Their decisions determine funding levels for fusion research programmes and set regulatory frameworks for safety and environmental protection. Political support from these individuals affects whether fusion research continues at scale or faces delays due to budget constraints.
    </p>

    <p>
      Private companies and investors, discussed mainly in Article 2, including firms such as Commonwealth Fusion Systems and Tokamak Energy, also exert growing influence by accelerating innovation, introducing high-temperature superconducting magnets, and pushing toward commercially focused designs. However, their influence is currently secondary to large public projects, as they still depend on foundational research from institutions like ITER and JET.
