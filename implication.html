    <h1>Question 1: Scientific Issue of Nuclear Fusion Development</h1>

    <p>
        The three articles collectively highlight the scientific issue of nuclear fusion development and achieving minimal
        carbon emissions. In Articles 1 and 2, the push for fusion energy has reached an exciting point with the recent
        milestone at the Joint European Torus (JET) in Oxfordshire, where scientists produced 69 megajoules of energy from
        just a tiny amount of fuel. This demonstrates that fusion could one day provide a nearly limitless, zero-carbon
        source of power.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, with this potential comes strong ethical responsibility. Scientists, governments, and institutions must
        ensure that fusion is developed safely, fairly, and for peaceful purposes, because the decisions made today will
        affect society for years to come. If fusion becomes a main source of energy, people will need new skills and
        education to work with and understand this technology, turning fusion into a challenge that is as social as it is
        scientific.
    </p>

    <p>
        How society adapts will also affect the economy, because building reactors, training experts, and reshaping energy
        systems all require significant long-term investment. Countries that fail to prepare socially may fall behind
        economically, while those that invest in people and infrastructure can gain both knowledge and industrial
        advantages.
    </p>

    <p>
        From a social perspective, fusion energy also has the potential to reduce inequalities in access to clean energy.
        Unlike fossil fuels, which are concentrated in certain countries and regions, hydrogen isotopes used in fusion are
        abundant and widely available. This could allow more nations to participate in a clean-energy future, improving
        energy equity and security. In this way, the social readiness of a population is directly connected to the ethical
        and environmental outcomes of fusion deployment.
    </p>

    <p>
        Money is a major factor in making fusion work, but it is no longer the biggest obstacle. Projects such as ITER in
        France and increasing private investment around the world show that funding is now available to turn experimental
        success into real energy production. These investments support scientific research, create new jobs, and drive
        innovation, while also helping to reduce costs over time.
    </p>

    <p>
        Economic choices also influence environmental outcomes. Moving from fossil fuels to fusion energy can reduce
        carbon emissions, limit pollution, and help slow climate change. Cleaner energy benefits society by protecting
        people and infrastructure from the long-term costs of environmental damage, supporting more sustainable economic
        growth.
    </p>

    <p>
        As highlighted in Article 3, new funding models, including private investment and international partnerships, make
        these high costs more manageable. Large-scale investment in fusion is no longer a barrier but a catalyst for
        progress. Financial backing accelerates research, encourages competition, and supports innovation, which can
        ultimately reduce costs and create entirely new industries.
    </p>

    <p>
        Fusion cannot be rushed, and safety, regulation, and public understanding must guide every step to avoid risks to
        workers, communities, and future generations. Achieving sustained nuclear fusion requires creating and controlling
        plasma at temperatures above 100 million degrees Celsius, maintaining magnetic confinement, and ensuring that
        reactor materials can withstand extreme neutron bombardment.
    </p>

    <p>
        These challenges require advanced engineering, new materials, and precise digital monitoring systems. Each
        technical breakthrough produces ripple effects across society and the economy by creating high-value jobs,
        training opportunities, and industrial growth. At the same time, the complexity of fusion reinforces the ethical
        need for caution, as premature deployment without sufficient safety measures could cause harm.
    </p>

    <p>
        Environmentally, the articles agree that fusion could significantly reduce reliance on fossil fuels and lower
        greenhouse gas emissions. Fusion produces very little waste, and its fuel is widely available, which could make
        clean energy accessible to many countries. Socially, this leads to cleaner air, improved public health, and more
        reliable energy supplies.
    </p>

    <p>
        Economically, fusion offers stable electricity production that supports businesses and long-term planning.
        Unlike solar or wind, fusion can provide a constant and reliable power supply, strengthening electricity grids
        and enabling economic growth without environmental harm.
    </p>

    <p>
        Overall, the three articles show that fusion energy development is not a single scientific breakthrough but an
        interconnected process. Article 1 establishes fusion’s scientific potential, Article 2 expands the discussion to
        ethical and societal readiness, and Article 3 identifies funding as the mechanism that links these factors
        together.
    </p>

    <p>
        This creates a clear causal chain: economic investment enables technical development, which supports environmental
        sustainability and improves socio-economic resilience through better public health and reduced climate-related
        damage. Addressing these implications together is essential if fusion is to become a safe, equitable, and
        sustainable energy solution for future generations.
