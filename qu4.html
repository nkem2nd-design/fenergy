    <h2>Question 4</h2>

    <p>
      The three articles collectively suggest several areas where further development and research are necessary before nuclear fusion can become a viable energy source. A primary area for further development is achieving sustained net energy gain, as both the JET experiments and the National Ignition Facility results are described as major scientific successes but only for very short durations and still fail to produce usable net electricity for the power grid. The articles repeatedly emphasise that current fusion machines consume as much or more energy than they generate. Further research is needed towards enhancing plasma stability and confinement time; optimised magnetic field configurations such as tokamaks and stellarators can help improve stability, while active control systems such as real-time feedback control and error field correction can increase confinement time.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is a clear need for further development of reactor materials that can withstand extreme conditions, as the articles explain that intense neutron bombardment damages reactor walls and cladding. The long-term effects of this degradation remain uncertain because fusion has never operated for extended periods under power-plant conditions. Fusion reactors require advanced refractory materials due to their high melting points and good thermal properties, enabling them to withstand harsh conditions for extended periods of operation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further research is needed into optimising tritium fuel breeding ratios and extraction, since tritium is scarce, radioactive, and short-lived. Although future reactors are designed to breed tritium using lithium blankets, the articles suggest that this process has not yet been proven at scale. Additional experimental validation is needed to confirm whether fusion power plants could produce sufficient fuel to remain operational without relying on external tritium supplies, which could be expensive to maintain.
    </p>

    <p>
      The articles highlight that scaling fusion technology from experimental reactors to power-plant-sized systems remains a major development challenge. Projects such as ITER continue to face delays, cost overruns, and engineering difficulties, indicating unresolved design and construction issues. Further development is required to improve reactor size, magnet efficiency, and maintenance systems to ensure reliable operation and economic viability, including exploration of more efficient designs such as smaller or spherical tokamaks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Further research is needed to assess the economic feasibility of fusion power plants. The articles highlight the need for reliable cost modelling. Before large-scale investment is committed, it is essential to scientifically evaluate whether the capital costs (start-up costs) and operational and maintenance costs of fusion energy are higher or lower compared to existing energy sources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fission, and renewable energy technologies.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, the articles imply that continued international collaboration and transparent communication are essential for future progress. Fusion research relies on shared expertise from large international projects and requires honest communication with the public about timelines, limitations, and uncertainties. Overall, these areas for further development demonstrate that while fusion has strong scientific potential, it cannot become a viable energy source without sustained research into plasma physics, materials science, fuel systems, engineering scalability, economic feasibility, and institutional readiness.
